WnndGws's Auto Ricing Bootstrap Script

# Motivation
I am writing this script because I do something often enough (once every 6-8months) where I want/need to reinstall Arch Linux on one of my computers. I am just following the same steps over and over, so I am attempting to automate this process

# The scripts
The scripts are intended to work only for me, tweaking can be done, but for now I have hardcoded everything

The scripts are intented to be run in order as each leaves the system in a state for the next one
